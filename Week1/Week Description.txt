Week 1 is all about going through the python basics chapters 1-6 in the book and going through it, 
I realized alot of it was stuff I already knew or was actively going over in CS 360 with Professor Brennan.
Therefore, to show I understand the topics covered in the book, I am including some CS 360 notes, or course 
work demonstrating my Python knowledge. 

Note: They are Jupyter Notebook files which differs from all of just plain py files from following weeks.
