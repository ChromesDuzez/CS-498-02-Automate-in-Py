For example if we have a fraction A and a fraction B, A.add(B) will add B to fraction A, modifying A.  At the end of each mathematical operation (add/subtact/multiply/divide) you will simplify the resulting fraction.  The method is _simplify, a \"private\" method that you should call at the end of each mathematical operation in addition to the class constructor.  \n",
